NOTE:
Starting over, will try implementing multiple tournaments

- Support more than one tournament in the database, so matches do not have to be deleted between tournaments. This will require distinguishing between “a registered player” and “a player who has entered in tournament #123”, so it will require changes to the database schema.
DONE

- Prevent rematches between players.

- Don’t assume an even number of players. If there is an odd number of players, assign one player a “bye” (skipped round). A bye counts as a free win. A player should not receive more than one bye in a tournament.
